    ```
    got this letter 
    where she wrote: 
    I'm not going to do the obvious and 
    throw in a photo 
    but don't worry 
    I've got a BODY 
    and the face 
    is not so bad 
    either. anyhow, I really admire 
    your books although 
    I just discovered them 
    recently. 
    you see I am 
    only 18 years old but 
    I'd like to be your 
    secretary 
    kind of keep house for you 
    answer the phone 
    all that 
    and just room and board 
    would doâ€” 
    no salary 
    and 
    I wouldn't ask you 
    for sex 
    unless you asked me first...
    
    you can be sure 
    I tossed that letter 
    into the 
    trash can 
    right away.
    ```
