## Excerpt
!!! quote "A Lady Of Soul"
    I met her in a bookstore. she was wearing a very short tight skirt, enormous high heels, and her breasts were quite evident even under the loose-fitting blue sweater. her face was very pointed, austere, no make-up, with a lower lip that didn't seem to hang quite right. but with a body like that you could forgive quite a number of things...
