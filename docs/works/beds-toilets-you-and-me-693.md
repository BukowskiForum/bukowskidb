!!! quote "beds, toilets, you and me (Love Is A Dog From Hell, 1977)"
    ```
    think of the beds
    used again and again
    to fuck in
    to die in.
    
    in this land
    some of us fuck more than
    we die
    but most of us die
    better than we
    fuck,
    and we die
    piece by piece too—
    in parks
    eating ice cream, or
    in igloos
    of dementia,
    or on straw mats
    or upon disembarked
    loves
    or
    or.
    
    :beds beds beds
    :toilets toilets toilets
    
    the human sewage system
    is the world's greatest
    invention.
    
    and you invented me
    and I invented you
    and that's why we don't
    get along
    on this bed
    any longer.
    you were the world's
    greatest invention
    until you
    flushed me
    away.
    
    now it's your turn
    to wait for the touch
    of the handle.
    somebody will do it
    to you,
    bitch,
    and if they don't
    you will—
    mixed with your own
    green or yellow or white
    or blue
    or lavender
    goodbye.
    ```
