## Excerpt
!!! quote "A Word On The Quick And Modern Poem-Makers"
    ```
    it is quite easy to appear modern and flip
    while in reality being the biggest damnfool ever born;
    I know: I have gotten away with some awful stuff
    but not nearly such awful pot as I read in the journals...
    ```
