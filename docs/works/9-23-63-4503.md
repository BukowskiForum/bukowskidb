!!! quote "9-23-63 (manuscript, 1963)"
    ```
    this night
    is
    frozen horses
    bow wow wow
    a line of skin
    between 
    the damndest
    places
    this night
    a flower
    in a pot
    growing
    in all the violent
    darkness
    sheathed back
    to the sinking
    of
    dandelions
    this night
    is all the 
    wallpaper
    in the world
    and everything
    unknown
    telling me
    unfair and
    break
    and never
    sleep
    this night
    ```
