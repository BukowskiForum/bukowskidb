## Excerpt
!!! quote "Notes of a Dirty Old Man"
    Margie was going to go out with this guy but on the way over this guy met another guy in a leather coat and the guy in the leather coat opened the leather coat and showed the other guy his tits and the other guy went over to Margie's and said he couldn't keep his date because this guy in the leather coat had showed him his tits and he was going to fuck this guy. So Margie went to see Carl, Carl was in, and she sat down and said to Carl, "This guy was going to take me to this caf√© with tables outside and we were going to drink wine and talk, just drink wine and talk, that's all, nothing else, but on the way over this guy met another guy in a leather coat and the guy in the leather coat showed the other guy his tits and now this guy is going to fuck the guy in the leather coat, so I don't get my tables and my wine and my talk."
    "I can't write," said Carl. "It's gone."...
