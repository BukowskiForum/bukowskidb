        ```
        too much
        too little
        or too late
        
        too fat
        too thin
        or too bad
        
        laughter or
        tears
        or immaculate
        unconcern
        
        haters
        lovers
        
        armies running through streets of pain
        waving wine bottles
        bayoneting and fucking everyone
        
        or an old guy in a cheap quiet room
        with a photograph of Marilyn Monroe.
        
        there is a loneliness in this world so great
        that you can see it in the slow movement of
        a clock's hands.
        
        there is a loneliness in this world so great
        that you can see it in blinking neon
        in Vegas, in Baltimore, in Munich.
        
        people are tired
        strafed by life
        mutilated either by love or no
        love.
        
        we don't need new governments
        new revolutions
        we don't need new men
        new women
        we don't need new ways
        we just need to care.
        
        people are not good to each other
        one on one.
        people are just not good to each other.
        
        we are afraid.
        we think that hatred signifies
        strength.
        that punishment is
        love.
        
        what we need is less false education
        what we need are fewer rules
        fewer police
        and more good teachers.
        
        we forget the terror of one person
        aching in one room
        alone
        unkissed
        untouched
        cut off
        watering a plant alone
        without a telephone that would never
        ring
        anyway.
        
        people are not good to each other
        people are not good to each other
        people are not good to each other
        
        and the beads swing and the clouds obscure
        and dogs piss upon rose bushes
        the killer beheads the child like taking a bite
        out of an ice cream cone
        while the ocean comes in and goes out
        in and out
        in the thrall of a senseless moon.
        
        and people are not good to each other.
        ```
    === "the crunch (Second Coming Magazine, 1977)"
        ```
        Too much
        too little
        or not enough
        
        too fat
        too thin
        or nobody
        
        laughter or
        tears
        or immaculate
        non-concern
        
        haters
        lovers
        
        armies running through streets of blood
        waving winebottles
        bayoneting and fucking virgins
        
        or an old guy in a cheap room
        with a photograph of Marilyn Monroe
        
        many old guys in cheap rooms without
        any photographs at all
        
        many old women rubbing rosaries
        when they'd prefer to be rubbing cocks
        
        there is a loneliness in this world so great
        that you can see it in the slow movements of
        the hands of a clock
        
        there is a loneliness in this world so great
        that you can see it blinking in neon signs
        in Vegas, in Baltimore, in Munich
        
        there are people so tired
        so strafed
        so mutilated by love or no
        love
        that buying a bargain can of tuna
        in a supermarket
        is their greatest moment
        their greatest victory
        
        we don't need new governments
        new revolutions
        we don't need new men
        new women
        we don't need new ways
        wife-swaps
        waterbeds
        good Columbian
        coke
        water pipes
        dildoes
        rubbers with corkscrew stems
        watches that give you the date
        
        people are not good to each other
        one on one.
        Marx be damned
        the sin is not the totality of certain systems.
        Christianity be damned
        the sin is not the killing of a God.
        
        people are just not good to each other.
        
        we are afraid
        we think that hatred means strength
        we think that New York City is the greatest
        city in America.
        
        what we need is less brilliance
        what we need is less instruction
        
        what we need are less poets
        what we need are less Bukowskies
        what we need are less Billy Grahams
        
        what we need is more
        beer
        a typist
        more finches
        more green-eyed whores who don't eat your heart
        like a vitamin pill
        
        we don't think about the terror of one person
        aching in one place
        
        alone
        untouched
        unspoken to
        watering a plant
        being without a telephone that will never
        ring
        because there isn't one.
        
        more haters than lovers
        
        slices of doom like taffeta
        
        people are not good to each other
        people are not good to each other
        people are not good to each other
        
        and the beads swing and the clouds cloud
        and the dogs piss upon the roses
        and the killer beheads the child like taking a bite
        out of an ice cream cone
        and the ocean comes in and out
        in and out
        under the direction of a senseless moon
        
        and people are not good to each other.
        ```

        too much 
        too little
        
        too fat
        too thin
        or nobody.
        
        laughter or
        tears
        
        haters
        lovers
        
        strangers with faces like
        the backs of
        thumb tacks
        
        armies running through
        streets of blood
        waving winebottles
        bayoneting and fucking
        virgins.
        
        an old guy in a cheap room
        with a photograph of M. Monroe.
        
        there is a loneliness in this world so great
        that you can see it in the slow movement of
        the hands of a clock
        
        people so tired
        mutilated
        either by love or no love.
        
        people just are not good to each other
        one on one.
        
        the rich are not good to the rich
        the poor are not good to the poor.
        
        we are afraid.
        
        our educational system tells us
        that we can all be
        big-ass winners.
        
        it hasn't told us
        about the gutters
        or the suicides.
        
        or the terror of one person
        aching in one place
        alone
        
        untouched
        unspoken to
        
        watering a plant.
        
        people are not good to each other.
        people are not good to each other.
        people are not good to each other.
        
        I suppose they never will be.
        I don't ask them to be.
        
        but sometimes I think about
        it.
        
        the beads will swing
        the clouds will cloud
        and the killer will behead the child
        like taking a bite out of an ice cream cone.
        
        too much
        too little
        
        too fat
        too thin
        or nobody
        
        more haters than lovers.
        
        people are not good to each other.
        perhaps if they were
        our deaths would not be so sad.
        
        meanwhile I look at young girls
        stems
        flowers of chance.
        
        there must be a way.
        
        surely there must be a way that we have not yet
        though of.
        
        who put this brain inside of me?
        
        it cries
        it demands
        it says that there is a chance.
        
        it will not say
        "no."
        ```
