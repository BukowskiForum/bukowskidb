## Excerpt
!!! quote "Notes of a Dirty Old Man"
    this column has already cost me an editor, one of the best bookmakers in America, I'll give odds, and I was going to say that this column might cost me a piece of ass, but how can you lose what you've never had? ah, I've HAD a piece of ass, friend, don't read me wrong, I am a clumsy writer. As far as THIS ass goes it's PAPER ass, and although the lady may claim all sorts of higher ideals, all ideals generally end up in the meat market, rotten meat, or on the springs: rotten lay. the lady should know from reading my stuff - I do not claim to be a gentleman, an idealist or a poet, I don't even care who wins the war...
