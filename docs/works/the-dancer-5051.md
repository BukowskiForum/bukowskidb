!!! quote "The Dancer (Letter, 1966)"
    ```
    he was a ballet dancer
    who spoke grandly of
    Sartre, of Genet, of
    Camus.
    we all thought him full of
    affectation
    until one day he
    cut his throat in the men's room
    behind stage.
    
    the ballet dancer never danced
    again, nor did we take him
    seriously after he was
    gone, even though
    it took the janitor 30 minutes to
    mop up the
    blood.
    ```
