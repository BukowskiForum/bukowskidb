## Excerpt
!!! quote "I Do Not Always Hate The Cat That Kills The Bird, Only The Cat That Kills Me"
    ```
    friend moon, friend cat, you ask no mercy or gigs or gifts,
    only lull and lavender. and houses. brush. movement
    as in a bowl.
    oh young men of Princeton puffing pipes...
    ```
