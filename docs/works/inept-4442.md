    ```
    everything is inept everywhere,
    see torn butterflies
    bad verse
    bad love,
    no man is wise enough to stay
    wise,
    cool hollow of dim pities
    where blood stank
    is soft now
    and not precious.
    we are struck through
    mixed with kittens and tigers,
    some life and
    no life
    at all;
    no army lasts, no night, no day;
    friend, these wallpaper flowers now
    without sun -
    they may last longer than even my
    dimmest concern, and
    properly so - yet
    why am I so
    sad?
    ```
