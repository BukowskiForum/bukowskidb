## Excerpt
!!! quote "Notes of a Dirty Old Man"
    Santa Anita, March 22, 1968, 3:10 p.m. I can't catch Quillo's Babe the even-money shot with Alpen Dance. the 4th race is over and I haven't touched a thing, I am $40.00 down, I should have had Boxer Bob in the 2nd with Bianco, one of the best unknown riders at the track at 9/5; any other jock, say Lambert or Pineda or Gonzales, the horse would have gone at 6/5 or even-money. but I've got an old saying (I make up old sayings as I walk around in rags) that knowledge without follow-through is worse than no knowledge at all...
