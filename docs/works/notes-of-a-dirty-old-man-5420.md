## Excerpt
!!! quote "Notes of a Dirty Old Man"
    Big Bart was the meanest man in the West and he had the fastest gun in the West and he fucked a larger variety of women in the West than anybody. He wasn't fond of bathing or bullshit or coming out second best. He was also the train boss of a load of wagon going West, and there wasn't a man his age who had killed more Indians or fucked more women or killed more white men. Big Bart was good, Big Bart was great and he knew it and everybody knew it...
