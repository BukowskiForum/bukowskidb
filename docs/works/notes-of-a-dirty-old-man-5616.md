## Excerpt
!!! quote "Notes of a Dirty Old Man"
    I imagine it hurts like hell to be torn to pieces and die for something different...every century, every 50 years, every 20 years. I read someplace where Man will eventually be replaced by robots he builds that will be more intelligent than he. It about figures: all they've got to do is stay out of the rain and the lightning and replace the parts as they wear ... they don't have to worry about toothache or hemorrhoids, or fucking. They'll just go on walking around the place looking for things to do, and there won't be much to do because they won't have to worry about eating and they won't be stupid enough to pay rent, and if they make the drunktank, they'll be smart enough to enjoy it...
