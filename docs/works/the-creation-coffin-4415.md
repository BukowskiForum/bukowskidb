    === "the creation coffin (The People Look Like Flowers At Last, 2007)"
        ```
        the ability to suffer and endure, 
        that's nobility, friend. 
        the ability to suffer and endure 
        for an idea, a feeling, a way, 
        that's art, my friend. 
        the ability to suffer and endure 
        when love fails, 
        that's hell, old friend. 
        nobility, art and hell, 
        let's talk about art for a while.
        
        destiny is my crippled daughter. 
        look here, it's difficult, 
        me against them, 
        with them. 
        Kafka, let me in! 
        Hemingway beware! Hegel, you're funny! 
        Cervantes, you mean you wrote that 
        novel at the age of 
        80?
        
        great writers are indecent people 
        they live unfairly 
        saving the best part for paper.
        
        good human beings save the world 
        so that bastards like me can keep creating art, 
        become immortal. 
        if you read this after I am long dead
        it means I made it.
        
        so writers of the world 
        it's your turn now 
        to misuse your wife 
        abuse your children 
        love thyself 
        live off the funds of others 
        dislike all art created before and 
        during your time, 
        and dislike or even hate humanity 
        singly or en masse.
        
        bastards, even if you read this 
        after I am long dead 
        forget about me. I 
        probably wasn't that 
        good.

    === "Measurements From the Creation Coffin: (Bachy Magazine, 1972)"
        ```
        the ability to suffer and endure -
        that's nobility, friend -
        the ability to suffer and endure
        for an idea, a feeling, a way -
        the ability to suffer and endure
        that's art, my friend -
        the ability to suffer and endure
        when a love ends -
        that's hell, old friend...
        nobility, art and hell,
        let's talk about art a while:
        
        promulgation of my attitudes
        like stilts walking centuries
        beeswax for brains
        destiny is my crippled daughter
        look here, it's difficult
        me against them
        with them
        Kafka let me in
        Hemingway beware
        Hegel you're funny
        Cervantes you mean you wrote that
        novel at the age of
        80?
        
        writers are indecent people
        they live unfairly
        saving the main part for paper
        
        jesus christ would have been
        a duller writer than Theodore Dreiser
        jesus christ would have been a
        very lousy writer
        
        the beard and hair fit
        but he was too good at
        conversations and
        miracles
        
        a good human being may save the world
        so the bastards can keep creating art
        if you read this after I am long dead
        it means I made it
        and
        it's your turn now
        to misuse your wife
        abuse your children
        love thyself
        live off the funds of others
        dislike all art created before and
        during your time,
        and dislike or even hate humanity
        singly or en mass
        
        bastard, if you read this after I am long dead
        shove me out of here. I
        probably wasn't that
        good.
        ```
