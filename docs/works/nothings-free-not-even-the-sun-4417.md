    === "nothing's free, not even the sun (Shattersheet, 1986)"
        ```
        got this letter 
        and she wrote: 
        I'm not going to do the obvious and 
        throw in a photo 
        but don't worry 
        I've got a BODY 
        and the face 
        is not bad 
        either. 
        anyhow, I've always really admired
        your writings although 
        I just heard of them 
        lately. 
        you see I am 
        only 18 years old but 
        I'd be glad to be your 
        secretary 
        kind of keep house for you 
        answer the phone 
        all that...
        and just room and board 
        would do— 
        no salary 
        and 
        I'd not bother you 
        if you 
        didn't want me 
        to...
        
        I tossed the letter 
        into the 
        trash.

        you can be sure 
        I tossed that letter 
        into the 
        trash can 
        right away.
