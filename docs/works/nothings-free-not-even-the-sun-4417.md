!!! quote "nothing's free, not even the sun (Shattersheet, 1986)"
    ```
    got this letter 
    and she wrote: 
    I'm not going to do the obvious and 
    throw in a photo 
    but don't worry 
    I've got a BODY 
    and the face 
    is not bad 
    either. 
    anyhow, I've always really admired
    your writings although 
    I just heard of them 
    lately. 
    you see I am 
    only 18 years old but 
    I'd be glad to be your 
    secretary 
    kind of keep house for you 
    answer the phone 
    all that...
    and just room and board 
    would do— 
    no salary 
    and 
    I'd not bother you 
    if you 
    didn't want me 
    to...
    
    I tossed the letter 
    into the 
    trash.
    ```
