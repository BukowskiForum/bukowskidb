!!! quote "A farewell Poem To Linda King (Linda King's unpublished book, 1972)"
    ```
    she drives away in her car
    in her precious car
    she drives
    away
    
    her car is so precious
    and her cunt is so
    precious
    
    Oh, I am once again asked
    to carry the pain of her
    going somewhere else
    to somebody
    else.
    
    I think that I will miss her car
    more than I will miss her
    I've gotten used to that blood red
    bitten by dust
    and that left front
    bare, plus
    smashed hood.
    
    maybe if men could love or
    fuck cars
    it would solve the thing
    but too many men do that
    don't they?
    
    I only want to love a woman
    but she won't
    arrive
    
    She will never arrive.
    
    maybe next year's model will be it
    with corrections
    
    I think that the years will run out
    with never the good love or the good way, this
    is to be expected, let us gird up
    valiantly
    to shit like to piss like
    the shit of perfection
    upon angels sucking asshole
    hairs.
    ```
