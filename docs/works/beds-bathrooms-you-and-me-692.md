    === "beds, bathrooms, you and me (Open All Night, 2000)"
        ```
        think of all the beds
        everywhere
        used again and again
        to love in
        to sleep in
        to die in.
        
        and all the bathrooms
        used again and again
        to bathe in
        sometimes to love in.
        
        in this land
        some of us love better than
        we die
        but most of us die
        better than we
        love
        and we die
        piece by piece
        bit by bit
        in parks
        eating ice cream, or
        in igloos
        equipped with refrigerators,
        of dementia,
        or on straw mats
        or upon disemboweled
        loves
        or
        or...
        
        beds beds beds
        bathrooms bathrooms bathrooms
        
        the human sleeping systems
        the human bathing systems
        are the world's greatest
        inventions.
        
        but we couldn't leave well
        enough alone.
        you re-invented me
        and I re-invented you
        and that's why we don't
        get along on
        this bed
        or in our bathroom
        any longer.
        ```
    === "beds, toilets, you and me (Love Is A Dog From Hell, 1977)"
        ```
        think of the beds
        used again and again
        to fuck in
        to die in.
        
        in this land
        some of us fuck more than
        we die
        but most of us die
        better than we
        fuck,
        and we die
        piece by piece too—
        in parks
        eating ice cream, or
        in igloos
        of dementia,
        or on straw mats
        or upon disembarked
        loves
        or
        or.

        the human sewage system
        is the world's greatest
        invention.
        
        and you invented me
        and I invented you
        and that's why we don't
        get along
        on this bed
        any longer.
        you were the world's
        greatest invention
        until you
        flushed me
        away.
        
        now it's your turn
        to wait for the touch
        of the handle.
        somebody will do it
        to you,
        bitch,
        and if they don't
        you will—
        mixed with your own
        green or yellow or white
        or blue
        or lavender
        goodbye.
        ```
