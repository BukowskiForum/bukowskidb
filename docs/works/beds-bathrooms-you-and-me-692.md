!!! quote "beds, bathrooms, you and me (Open All Night, 2000)"
    ```
    think of all the beds
    everywhere
    used again and again
    to love in
    to sleep in
    to die in.
    
    and all the bathrooms
    used again and again
    to bathe in
    sometimes to love in.
    
    in this land
    some of us love better than
    we die
    but most of us die
    better than we
    love
    and we die
    piece by piece
    bit by bit
    in parks
    eating ice cream, or
    in igloos
    equipped with refrigerators,
    of dementia,
    or on straw mats
    or upon disemboweled
    loves
    or
    or...
    
    beds beds beds
    bathrooms bathrooms bathrooms
    
    the human sleeping systems
    the human bathing systems
    are the world's greatest
    inventions.
    
    but we couldn't leave well
    enough alone.
    you re-invented me
    and I re-invented you
    and that's why we don't
    get along on
    this bed
    or in our bathroom
    any longer.
    ```
