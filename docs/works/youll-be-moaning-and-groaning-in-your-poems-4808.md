!!! quote "you'll be moaning and groaning in your poems... (manuscript, 1974)"
    ```
    she writes, you'll be moaning and groaning
    in your poems
    about how I fucked two guys in one week,
    I know you.
    then she writes on to say 
    that my vibe machine was right,
    she had just fucked another guy
    but she knows I don't want to hear 
    who, why or how. 
    she signs her letter, 
    Love, -----.
    
    moan, groan.
    moan, groan.
    
    groan
    moan.
    
    you're right again, my
    love.
    
    7-9-74
    ```
