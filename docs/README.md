# Bukowski Database Notes

- This is a catalog of the author Charles Bukowski's [books](books/index.md), [broadsides](broadsides/index.md), [letters](letters/index.md), [magazine appearances](magazines/index.md), [manuscripts](manuscripts/index.md), [recordings](recordings/index.md), and [works](works/index.md). It's maintained by [Bukowski Forum](https://bukowskiforum.com) members. 
- To add or correct information, read the [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md), or [propose changes](https://bukowskiforum.com/threads/database-updated.5438/).
- Nearly all the content is a gift from Hannah who started the database in 1995, as well as others mentioned in the original notes below.

!!! quote "Old Database Notes"
    - For the sake of consistency the work titles are capitalized, though Bukowski often did not capitalize (or wrote ALL CAPS titles).
    - Story titles are italicized.
    - Titles that end with extraneous punctuation such as --- or : have had the trailing punctuation removed.
    - "Written in..." dates are based on manuscripts. "Written circa..." dates are based on small press publication or manuscript type (i.e., carbon paper copy, Xerox copy, computer printout), and are generally accurate within a year or two.
    - Where excerpts are included, they are the first four lines of the poem from the earliest published version available.
    - Page numbers for book entries correspond to the original Black Sparrow editions. Other or later printings may differ.
    - "Alternate titles or versions, draft titles" indicates either different titles for the same poem, different versions of the same poem, or early draft titles of the same poem.
    - Some manuscript results are appended with the notation; "Manuscript differs from collected version." Significant changes between the manuscripts and the published versions of the poems were relatively uncommon during Bukowski's lifetime, but such changes became common shortly after his death. We include this notation so the original work can be referenced.
    - Because he was published in so many "little" magazines, it is virtually impossible to compile a complete database of Bukowski's work. While this is the most complete and comprehensive resource available anywhere, it will always be a work in progress. New discoveries/additions are made on the average of once every 11 days.

    ## The database draws from a large pool of sources, contributors and collectors. Significant amounts of information were provided by the good folks below.
